Welcome to my project!

I built a react portfolio website. I have been wanting to build a portfolio website for a long time so im glad this project gave me th motivation to learn some new skills and create a website i can share with others. 
My app has a few cool features. The app is responsive to fit appropriately to various monitor sizes as well as tablets and phones. 
The app uses react states in the navigation bar at the bottom that takes you to the appropriate part of the page, and highlights the section you are working on.
There are also a few animations throughout my sight.
The site uses react icons to give a clean look to the components.
The portfolio section of the site, currently just points you to github, but in future efforts i will make the source code for different projects available and as they are hosted, the live demo will forward them to the site.
One of my favorite sections is the contacts. If you click the email or facebook messenger option it will open those applications respectufully and allow you to send a message to me with my info auto filled. The contact form uses email.js to send an email to my personal inbox directly from the site.

I watched youtube tutorials for a large part of creating the website as i simply needed the additional assistance to use react. I implemeneted alot of my own code to make things look and function how i peronally wanted. The tutorials and this exercise helped me greatly in figuring out how to use react and create a personal website. The css is all raw as well and followed with some tutorials, however i changed many aspects of it to look how i wanted including sizing and media queries to fit smaller displays.

I delpoyed with netlify. I had issues deploying for many attempts and eventually had to put a custom command to build the website. I have a few warnings when compiling and i had to ensure the site didnt treat the warnings as errors and stop the build. 

Overall im satisfied with the work i was able to do and hope you enjoy the website.
